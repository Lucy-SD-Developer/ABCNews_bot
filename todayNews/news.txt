Tropical Storm Laura and Tropical Storm Marco are both expected to travel towards the Gulf of Mexico in the next few days, with both storms likely to impact parts of the U.S. coast by the early half of next week.


Official Laura and Marco forecasts currently only show Laura becoming a Hurricane. However, if both were to become hurricanes in the Gulf of Mexico at the same time, it would be the first time on record that has happened.


The last time there were two tropical cyclones in the Gulf was in 2002, where Tropical Storm Fay was off the Texas coast, and Tropical Depression Edouard was off the Florida west coast, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.

Tropical Storm Laura has winds of 40 mph Saturday and is currently 70 miles east southeast of San Juan, Puerto Rico. The storm is moving west at 21 mph.


Laura is disorganized Saturday morning and will move over parts of the Caribbean through this weekend.


There is a tropical storm warning in effect for parts of the Caribbean, including Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands.

On the current forecast track, Laura will move near Puerto Rico Saturday morning, then Hispaniola in the afternoon and night, and then near Cuba on Sunday.


Tropical storm force winds extend up to 205 miles from the center, mainly on the northern side of the storm. Wind gusts over 45 mph will be possible in Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands in the next few hours.


Laura is expected to bring up to 8 inches of rain from Puerto Rico to Cuba. This could result in mudslides and flash flooding. Puerto Rico got hit pretty hard by Isaias just a few weeks ago with major flash flooding.

The track and intensity of Laura remain somewhat uncertain as we get into next week since Laura could interact with quite a bit of land this weekend.


Laura is expected to reach the Gulf on Tuesday.


Tropical Storm Marco has winds of 45 mph Saturday morning and is about 115 miles east southeast of Cozumel, Mexico. The storm is moving north-northwest at 12 mph. A hurricane watch has been issued for parts of Mexico, including Cancun.


Tropical storm warnings are also in effect for that region as well.

Marco is expected near the Yucatan Peninsula later Saturday and then move into the Gulf of Mexico on Sunday. The storm will then move northward and likely turn northwest as it moves towards the U.S. coast by Tuesday.


Tropical storm force winds extend 70 miles from the center. Locally, up to 10 inches of rainfall will be possible in the Yucatan Peninsula, which could result in flash flooding.

It is still too early to determine the location and magnitude of the impacts Marco will bring to the U.S.

Steve Bannon slammed his arrest on Wednesday, calling it "a political hit job" and "nonsense," while vowing to fight the charges against him. He also reiterated his allegedly criminal efforts to build a wall on the U.S.-Mexico border were in support of President Donald Trump.


"Are these charges are nonsense; this is a political hit job," Bannon repeated at least three times during his radio show, "WarRoom," on Friday.


"Everybody knows I love a fight," he said. "I'm in this for the long haul and I'm in this for the fight."

Bannon, Trump's former campaign head and chief strategist at the White House, was arrested on Thursday and charged with conspiracy to commit wire fraud and money laundering in connection with a crowdfunding effort to build a wall along the southern border. Bannon allegedly took at least $1 million of the money raised from supporters to pay another group leader's lavish personal expenses, according to prosecutors.


During the radio show on Friday, Bannon said his actions were in support of the president, who has since tried to distance himself from his top adviser.

"This was to show support for President Trump in the wall movement and the wall has to be built," Bannon said, claiming that the charges are an effort to "intimidate" people who support the president. This was to stop and intimidate people that want to talk about the wall. This is to stop and intimidate people that have President Trump's back on building the wall."


White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany said in a statement on Thursday that Trump "has not been involved with Steve Bannon since the campaign and the early part of the Administration, and he does not know the people involved with this project."

"President Trump has no involvement in this project and felt it was only being done in order to showboat, and perhaps raise funds," she continued.


Bannon also wondered aloud if the timing of his arrest so close to the election was for political purposes, though there is no evidence this is the case.


"The timing is exquisite," he said, "We have 72 [days until Election Day] and a wake up to what Donald Trump says is the most important election."

PORTLAND, Ore. -- 
Smoke filled the air outside a police precinct in Portland, Oregon, as authorities worked to clear a crowd accused of damaging patrol vehicles, throwing projectiles and pointing lasers at officers.

Police declared a riot early Saturday outside the department's north precinct. Smoke was deployed and officers physically forced protesters away from the area, news outlets reported.

Windows were broken on patrol vehicles, police said, and items such as glass bottles were thrown and lasers were aimed at officers. Videos posted online showed several people being detained after the riot declaration, but it wasn't immediately clear how many arrests may have been made. 

On Friday, protesters clashed with federal agents outside a U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement building. People in a group of about 100 late Thursday and before dawn Friday sprayed the building with graffiti, hurled rocks and bottles at agents and shined laser lights at them, Portland police said.

The agents set off smoke or tear gas and used crowd control munitions to try to disperse the crowd. Three people were arrested.

Also Friday,         a number of federal buildings across the city were closed as the FBI investigated a car bomb threat.

Violent demonstrations have happened in Oregon’s largest city for more than two months following the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis police custody.

Tropical Storm Laura and Tropical Storm Marco are both expected to travel toward the Gulf of Mexico in the next few days, with both storms likely to impact parts of the U.S. coast by the early half of next week.


Marco and Laura are not expected to become hurricanes at the same time. Marco currently is forecasted to become a hurricane Saturday night until Monday morning. Laura is forecasted to become a hurricane Tuesday and Wednesday.


While it is too early to determine the exact magnitude and location of U.S. mainland impact from Marco and Laura, parts of the U.S. Gulf Coast from Texas to Mississippi may see impact from two different tropical systems in the upcoming week.


Louisiana and Mississippi have both already declared states of emergency in anticipation of the storms.


The last time there were two tropical cyclones in the Gulf was in 2002, where Tropical Storm Fay was off the Texas coast, and Tropical Depression Edouard was off the Florida west coast, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.

Tropical Storm Laura has winds of 50 mph Saturday evening and was 125 miles east-southeast of Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic. The storm is moving west at 18 mph.


A tropical storm watch is now in effect for the Florida Keys and portions of the central/southeastern Bahamas. A tropical storm warning remains in effect from Puerto Rico through Hispaniola and for much of Cuba.


Laura brought heavy rain and gusty winds to parts of Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands Saturday. The center is passing just to the south.


Laura is forecast to go near or over Hispaniola and Cuba over the 48 hours and this could significantly impact the storm's strength and structure. Depending on how it holds together, its strength moving into the Gulf of Mexico will be greatly impacted. But as of now, the latest forecast calls for strengthening once in the Gulf of Mexico, reaching hurricane strength as it closes in on the U.S. Gulf Coast.

On the current forecast track, Laura will move near Hispaniola on Saturday afternoon and night, and then near Cuba on Sunday.


Tropical storm force winds extend up to 205 miles from the center, mainly on the northern side of the storm. Wind gusts over 45 mph will be possible in Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands in the next few hours.


Laura is expected to bring up to 8 inches of rain from Puerto Rico to Cuba. This could result in mudslides and flash flooding. Puerto Rico got hit pretty hard by Isaias just a few weeks ago with major flash flooding.

The track and intensity of Laura remain somewhat uncertain as we get into next week since Laura could interact with quite a bit of land this weekend.


Laura is expected to reach the Gulf on Tuesday.


Tropical Storm Marco has been strengthening much of the day and getting better organized. Sustained winds were at 65 mph Saturday night and it was moving north-northwest at 13 mph. The center was about 50 miles wast of Cuba.


A hurricane watch is in effect from Intracoastal City, Louisiana, to the Mississippi/Alabama state line. A tropical storm watch has been issued for the Alabama coast with storm surge watches along portions of the northern Gulf Coast as well. Marco is forecast to strengthen into a hurricane Saturday night.


Tropical storm warnings remain in effect across portions of the Yucatan Peninsula and western Cuba Saturday.


Marco is forecast to continue to strengthen over the next 24 hours and likely become a hurricane by Saturday night. However, atmospheric conditions will be much less favorable as the storm nears the Gulf Coast. Weakening is expected ahead of any landfall.

Marco is expected near the Yucatan Peninsula later Saturday and then move into the Gulf of Mexico on Sunday. The storm will then move northward and likely turn northwest as it moves towards the U.S. coast by Tuesday.


Tropical storm force winds extend 70 miles from the center. Locally, up to 10 inches of rainfall will be possible in the Yucatan Peninsula, which could result in flash flooding.

It is still too early to determine the location and magnitude of the impacts Marco will bring to the U.S.


While it's unclear what the storms will bring, Louisiana's St. Bernard Parish, southeast of New Orleans, is already making sandbags available to residents.


"I am very proud of the way the residents of St. Bernard Parish have rallied together in the face of this weather event. The effort we have seen today by both residents and parish employees with the new sandbagging procedures has been exceptional," said Parish President Guy S. McInnis in a statement.

PORTLAND, Ore. -- 
Federal authorities on Saturday forced demonstrators away from a plaza near a federal building as dueling demonstrations in Portland by right-wing and left-wing protesters turned violent.

The area includes county and federal buildings and has been the site of numerous recent protests. 

Department of Homeland Security officers moved through the plaza across from an 18-story federal building. A federal courthouse is also near that area.

Violent demonstrations have gripped Portland for months, following the police killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis police custody.

The demonstration began at about noon near the Multnomah County Justice Center in Oregon’s biggest city, local media outlets reported. Demonstrators hurled rocks and other items at each other and got into fights. Streets were blocked amid the mayhem.

Images showed what appeared to be hundreds of people involved, many of them wearing helmets and carrying makeshift shields. Some demonstrators appeared to use pepper spray during clashes, and at least one person appeared to pull a gun. No arrests were reported.

The Justice Center in recent weeks has been the target of left-wing protesters mostly operating at night, when they frequently get into clashes with police. Saturday afternoon's demonstrations spread to other areas as crowds marched.

Right-wing groups had announced a rally near the Justice Center Saturday afternoon that quickly drew counter demonstrators. The building houses a police precinct, police headquarters, a county jail and courtrooms and is next door to a federal courthouse that was targeted for weeks last month by left-wing protesters who clashed with federal agents dispatched to Portland to protect it.

The protesters at Saturday's demonstration included the Proud Boys right-wing group and left-wing protest groups Democratic Socialists of America and Popular Mobilization, The Oregonian/OregonLive reported.

Portland police issued a warning about two hours after the demonstrations began, warning that officers were prepared to start using crowd control weapons if the violence did not end. By late afternoon, the crowds had dwindled.

In a statement, Portland Police said there had been questions about why the gathering wasn't declared a riot and why city police officers didn't intervene. Incident commanders have to determine whether police action will make things more dangerous, the statement said.

“In this case there were hundreds of individuals and many weapons within the groups and an extremely limited amount of police resources actually available to address such a crowd," police said.. “Additionally, (Portland police officers) have been the focus of over 80 days of violent actions directed at the police, which is a major consideration for determining if police resources are necessary to interject between two groups with individuals who appear to be willingly engaging in physical confrontations for short durations.”

The Saturday afternoon clashes followed predawn clashes between police and about 200 left-wing protesters outside a different police precinct. President Donald Trump on Saturday morning tweeted: “Another bad night of Rioting in Portland, Oregon,"

Demonstrators hurled bottles and rocks at officers and pointed lasers at them, damaging police cars and causing minor injuries for several officers, Portland police said in a statement.

One protester was given medical treatment at the scene after he threw rocks at officers and was shot with what police described as a “sponge-tipped less-lethal round," the statement said.

He was among nine people arrested. Three were charged with assault on a police officer.
